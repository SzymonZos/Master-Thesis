\section{Realized tasks}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial research in fields of image processing and compression, analysis of JPEG 2000 algorithm. 
    \item More advanced research of algorithms such as DWT, SS-DWT, HP and JPEG 2000 implementation - Kakadu.
    \item Development of basic DWT implementation.
    \item Development of advanced 2D DWT implementation with possibility of skipping transformation of columns or rows.
    \item Setup of Continuous Integration system and implementation of DWT testing component 
    \item Development of initial heuristics allowing to study the effects of DWT modifications compliant
    with the JPEG 2000 standard such as decompositions into sub-bands and usage of different filters
    \item Support of loading and storing both grayscale and color images.
    \item Initial implementation of multi-threaded heuristics.
    \item Conducting preliminary tests and selecting modifications or their variants to be included in the final heuristics.
    \item Development of multi-threaded optimized implementation of final heuristics.
    \item Research on final heuristics - comparison in terms of obtained compression ratio and time with: unmodified JPEG 2000,
    SS-DWT transformation and the transformation determined by an exhaustive search.
